ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Rick Visser, a passionate Laravel developer and owner of Progics. I'm currently expanding my expertise to become a Magento developer. I enjoy building dynamic and efficient web applications, using technologies such as PHP, SQL, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Laravel, Livewire, Vue, React Native, and Alpine.

Feel free to check out my projects and connect with me!
